School Management System (Python + MySQL – Desktop → Web)

Overview
This project tackles core challenges in school data management—data synchronization, secure file sharing, and safeguarding sensitive student details. It starts as a desktop application built in Python, using a GUI (Tkinter/PyQt), with a MySQL backend. In future iterations, it will evolve into a full-fledged web app using Django.

Key Features
1. Desktop Version
User-friendly GUI: Interfaces built in Python (Tkinter or PyQt) allow smooth interaction for both admins and students 

Student profiles: Each student record generates a unique admission number, and their data (results, progress, etc.) is stored in a dedicated MySQL database.

Secure login: Students log in with their first name and a default password to access results. Admins have full rights—including adding users, editing databases, and ensuring security.

2. Data Management & Security
Separation per student: Each student gets their own database schema to prevent unauthorized cross-access.

Synchronization & backups: Built-in routines ensure data consistency during file sharing or multiple user access.

Access control: Authentication and role-based permissions protect sensitive information.

3. Future Roadmap: Django Web Migration
Transition to web: The desktop app’s functionality (student login, result viewing, admin dashboard) will be ported into Django using its models, views, and authentication system .

Web-based admin console: Admins will manage users, admission numbers, and student records through Django’s admin panel.

Scalable architecture: Django ORM and MySQL will support future enhancements—like file uploads, multi-user syncing, reporting tools, analytics, and eventual deployment to a production server.
